Task 1: Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques 
Research and Summarize: Explore advanced prompt engineering techniques such as zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting.Describe each technique and its applications.


Task 2: Design and Experiment Prompt Design Experiment: 
-Select an AI model available to you for experimentation (e.g., GPT-3.5 or newer versions, if accessible).
-Design a set of prompts that illustrate zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought techniques. Choose a complex topic or task for these prompts (e.g., solving a math problem, explaining a scientific concept, or providing advice on a niche topic).
-Document the AI's responses to each prompt type and analyze the effectiveness and limitations observed in each approach.
